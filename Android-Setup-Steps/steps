Steps

-run react-native init <ProjectName>

-open project in text editor

-open android folder, and access local.properties file. Path should be specified as such: Users/<UserName>/Library/Android/sdk

-Install Java (brew install Caskroom/versions/java7)

-Install Android Studio.

-Access SDK Manager on Android Studio. Link at the bottom to Launch Android SDK Manager.

-Install ALL BUILD TOOLS for whatever Android version you're using. Also install your preferred Android version (for us, it was Android 6.0 (API 23)).

ERROR AT THIS POINT: * What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:installDebug'.
> com.android.builder.testing.api.DeviceException: No connected devices!

-Install Virtual Box (virtualbox.org) and Genymotion (genymotion.com). Genymotion creates a virtual Android emulator. Virtual Box allows you to run Android OS on your Mac.

-After installing genymotion, go to Settings and select the ADB tab. Select 'Use custom Android SDK tools' and enter the path specified in your local.propeties file.

-Add the actual virtual device that runs the version of Android the you have installed. (For us, Android API 23).

-Finally, run react-native run-android. The build should succeed. Umm, yeah. If it failed, you're in for a long day. If the installation of the virtual box freezes anywhere, restart your system and start again.
